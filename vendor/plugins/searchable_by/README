SearchableBy
============

This simple plugin will create for you a named scope which you can use
for a quick search. You can specify which fields and how should be searched

Installation
============

Inside your rails application root, run

git submodule add git://github.com/MadRabbit/searchable_by.git vendor/plugins/searchable_by
git submodule init


Example
=======

This will return you all the users which login or email is like '%asdf%'

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchable_by :login, :email
end

User.like('asdf').all 

By default if you don't specify anything but feild-names all of them will
be matched by the " LIKE '%serach%' rule.


But you can specify some additional matching logic

class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchable_by :title => :like,     # for LIKE '%?%' search (caseinsensitive)
                :url   => :begin     # for LIKE '?%'  search (caseinsensitive)
                :kind  => :end,      # for LIKE '%?'  search (caseinsensitive)
                :hash  => :exact,    # for exact case sensitive match
                :ISBN  => :exact_i   # for exact case insensitive match
                
end

You can specify additional parameters for your named scope by passing an
options hash to the end of the arguments list. Like that

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :role
  
  searchable_by {:login => :like, 'roles.name' => :exact}, {
    :include => :role, :order => 'users.login'
  }
end

By default the name of the named scope will be 'like', but you can specify
any name you want in the options hash.

class Dog < ActiveRecord::Base
  searchable_by :breed, :method_name => 'with_breed'
end

Dog.with_breed('Pitbull')
